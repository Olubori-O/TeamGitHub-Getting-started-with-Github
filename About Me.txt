With over six years of experience in digital marketing, website management, content creation and vendor relationships, I have demonstrated competence in the different aspects of marketing and communications towards sustainable business profitability and strategic brand positioning.
Given my BA in English, my specialties include problem solving, website optimization, quality assurance and learning new skills.
I am an enthusiastic, result-driven, self-motivated individual comfortable working collaboratively,
virtually, and independently, with great attention to details.
